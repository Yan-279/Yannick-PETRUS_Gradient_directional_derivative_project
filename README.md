# Yannick-PETRUS_Gradient_directional_derivative_project

# Required libraries : numdifftools, numpy

 This project takes coordinates of a point in R2 (int or float)
 Gives the gradient of the function f = (x^3 * y) - (x * y^3) at that point
 Takes the 2 coordinates of a vector
 Gives the directional derivative of f at that point in the direction of the vector
